# PosturePal
A simple posture detection system using the eSense earables to track head position and orientation.

Tested on Linux and Android.

When the app starts, navigate to the preferences page and enter your eSense device's name.
Confirm the input! (this holds for free text all input fields)
Then press connect. Shortly after, the visualization on the home page should be running.

Have fun playing around with the configuration options!
